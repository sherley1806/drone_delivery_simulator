 Drone Delivery Simulator (Python Project)

 Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based simulation of a drone delivery system.  
The program takes the starting and destination coordinates from the user and calculates:
- Distance between the two points
- Estimated travel time of the drone
This simulates the basic logic behind drone navigation and delivery systems.
 Objectives
- To understand how drone movement can be modeled using coordinates
- To apply mathematical distance formulas in real-world scenarios
- To build a basic simulation using Python
 Technologies Used
- Python (Core concepts)
- Mathematical computation
- Console-based input/output
 How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python is installed  
2. Download the file `drone_delivery.py`  
3. Open terminal in that folder  
4. Run:
python drone_delivery.py
5. After running the command, the program will ask for coordinates.
Example input:
0
0
4
3
6. The program will then display the calculated distance and estimated drone travel time.
 Sample Output:
Drone Delivery Simulator
Enter starting X coordinate: 0
Enter starting Y coordinate: 0
Enter destination X coordinate: 4
Enter destination Y coordinate: 3
Distance: 5.0
Estimated travel time: 0.12 hours
